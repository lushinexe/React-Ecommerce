# Ecommerce with React.js and Vite

This project is a basic ecommerce app built with **React.js** and **Vite**. The project showcases key concepts including **React Context** for global state management and **React Router** for dynamic page routing.

## About This Project

This eCommerce application serves as a hands-on example for creating a functional React-based storefront.

I built it from scratch to create a step-by-step tutorial for my YouTube channel, where I explain the entire development process in a clear and beginner-friendly way.
